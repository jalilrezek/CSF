Stack poitner alignment:

There's some combination of (maybe pushqs, maybe a subq). And there's the original offset by 8 bytes from calling the function
itself. The way it works is, you just need to make sure that the stack pointer is aligned to a multiple of 16.
So since calling the function offsets it by 8, basically you need to make sure the combination of (pushqs & subqs)
totals up to an odd multipe of 8 to cancel out the offset from calling the function.
