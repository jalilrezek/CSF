rdi + 8 points to a memory address that cannot be dereferenced.

How did you push on the stack? Did you subq rsp by 4 * (num_pixels)? 
    How do you actually access them in the loop though? Aren't they just at some offset from rdi/rsi?
    So how does pushing onto the stack change anything?
    Do you load each individual pixel into some stack space and then access it?
    No need for malloc?
